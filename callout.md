Meeting records Recording 

Summary
Jaromir Hradilek and Emily Murphy announced the retirement of the "link attribute" rule and clarified that "related links" still need to be a single link in a bullet point. Emily Murphy confirmed the validity of an alternative cross-reference format if it functions as valid AsciiDoc. Emily Murphy and Jaromir Hradilek acknowledged Ralph Dlugy-Hegwer's contributions in creating a script for extracting links. Emily Murphy announced the decision to remove callouts, which Jaromir Hradilek clarified as a stylistic choice for accessibility, not a tooling limitation. Emily Murphy also presented updated guidance and examples for replacing callouts, which Kerry Carmichael and Paul Mellor inquired about regarding their availability and CQA status. Jaromir Hradilek provided information on tools and the responsibility for content fixes, emphasizing that authors are responsible for ensuring text clarity. Jiri Herrmann, Jaromir Hradilek, and Felicia Kleinfelt discussed block titles and automatic conversions, highlighting the need for manual fixes for semantic meaning. Felicia Kleinfelt and Jaromir Hradilek clarified requirements for assembly structure and short descriptions. Lastly, Andrew Munro, Emily Murphy, and Jaromir Hradilek discussed nested assemblies and the case-by-case recommendations for complex upstream content.

Details
Links and Cross-References Policy Update Jaromir Hradilek announced a significant update regarding links and cross-references, stating that the "link attribute" rule will be retired, meaning that authors no longer need to worry about its formatting as long as it works in their current document. However, "related links" still need to be fixed to be a single link in a bullet point. Emily Murphy confirmed that additional resources still require the removal of surrounding or explanatory text.
Alternative Cross-Reference Format Validity Emily Murphy clarified that an alternative cross-reference format, which Andrew Munro inquired about, is valid if it functions as valid AsciiDoc, and conversion tooling will handle it correctly. Jaromir Hradilek confirmed that the display text for cross-references is not a concern, even if it is missing.
Acknowledgement of Ralph Dlugy-Hegwer's Contributions Emily Murphy and Jaromir Hradilek acknowledged and thanked Ralph Dlugy-Hegwer for their script that extracts links and places them into the attributes file, although this is no longer a necessary task due to updated policies. Ralph Dlugy-Hegwer expressed gratitude for the feedback and comments that helped them, and also thanked Adam for the Veil rule.
Decision to Remove Callouts Emily Murphy announced that the meeting's main topic would be callouts, explaining that Jaromir Hradilek would provide context on the decision to remove them from documents. Jaromir Hradilek clarified that the decision to discontinue callouts was a stylistic choice based on competitive analysis and accessibility concerns, not a tooling limitation, and that the conversion tooling has a fallback to bold text if authors do not fix callouts.
Guidance and Examples for Replacing Callouts Emily Murphy discussed the updated supplementary style guide, which now includes examples and guidance for replacing callouts. She presented four examples: a single callout replaced by a sentence, a YAML file using a definition list, a combination of user-replaceable values and explanations, and a complex scenario addressed with two definition lists.
Availability of Examples and CQA Status of Callout Fixes Kerry Carmichael inquired about definition list examples in the style guide and the availability of the provided examples, to which Emily Murphy confirmed she is compiling a document of specific examples and can share the current ones in a zip file. Paul Mellor asked if callout replacement would be a separate Jira issue, and Jaromir Hradilek clarified that it is considered part of CQA, with Veil starting to report callouts about half a month prior.
Tools and Responsibility for Content Fixes Jaromir Hradilek mentioned that Gurudaf shared a script for solving callouts in YAML examples by generating valid YAML paths as definitions, which writers can explore for their use cases. They emphasized that authors are ultimately responsible for ensuring the text makes sense and is helpful to customers, regardless of the fixing method.
Block Titles and Automatic Conversions Jiri Herrmann asked about automatic conversions for incompatible elements like block titles, as Jaromir Hradilek had mentioned the tooling can convert them to bold text. Jaromir Hradilek clarified that while the tooling has fallbacks to preserve content, authors are still expected to fix these issues manually for a cleaner and semantically meaningful output, as bold text lacks semantic meaning. Felicia Kleinfelt added that some block titles are necessary for conversion, such as "prerequisites" and "procedure" in procedures, and advised evaluating each error to determine the best fix.
Assembly Structure and Short Descriptions Felicia Kleinfelt confirmed that the `ro_abstract` tag is required for all modules, including assemblies, which will convert to concept modules unless they contain procedures, in which case they should be converted to procedure modules. Jaromir Hradilek simplified this, stating that if an assembly has a title, it needs a short description because it will become a concept module in DITA, which requires a short description. Emily Murphy indicated this might require further offline discussion due to common non-standard practices.
Nested Assemblies and Upstream Content Andrew Munro asked about nested assemblies, and Emily Murphy and Jaromir Hradilek confirmed that they are not a problem for conversion. Andrew Munro also brought up the issue of complex upstream content formats, to which Jaromir Hradilek stated that recommendations for converting such content will be provided on a case-by-case basis during Phase One engagement with the migration team, and for now, authors should continue as they are.

Suggested next steps
Emily Murphy will send out the examples of the definition list in a zip file to the group after the call.
Jaromir Hradilek will retire the link attribute rule.
Emily Murphy, Jaromir Hradilek, and Felicia Kleinfelt will have a more structured session on the issue of assembly files and master ADOC.
